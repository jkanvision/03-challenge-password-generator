# 03-Challenge-Password-Generator

## Description:
The "Password Generator" webpage produces a randomly generated password that matches the user's preferences. This webpage features a simple design with window prompts that guide the user through the selection process. Users are asked to choose the length of the generated password and can choose what kind of characters to include. The randomly generated password is diplayed in a form text-box, centered on the page, and written in a large font-size for maximum readability.
